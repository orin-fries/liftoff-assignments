# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Creating a design system featuring reusable components so I can develop my understanding of how design system implementation works and further refine my understanding of UI/UX design with an emphasis on end user ease-of-use and scalability for clients.

### Features
Reusable Components: 
- Layouts, colors, typefaces, material theming. All will be WGAC and A11Y compliant.
- Basic HTML page layouts
- Comments, alerts, textboxes and fields


### Technologies
-HTML5 (emphasis on semantic coding and accessibility)
-CSS3 
-JS (Vanilla, Node, React.js)

### What I'll Have to Learn
-Seeing React.js in a ton of jobs these days (as well as Vue, but I'll tackle that one later!), so I'd like to challenge myself to become familiar with it in this project. It seems like it is well-suited for these kinds of reusable components. 
*Would it take the place of Angular in the project, in terms of creating reusable objects and templates, or could I use both in the project? Gotta research that more!

-TailWind or Sass for CSS! Lots of friendly, easily scalable CSS innovation nowadays. I particularly love Sass' use of variables and I also have encountered it in a ton of job postings.

Also further developing my understanding of what goes into design system creation, what makes UX/UI intuitive and user-friendly (and how do I test that on a small scale without doing focus group testing and having a QA department), what kind of components make the most sense to include and how to make them high-level and easily customizable by an end client.
